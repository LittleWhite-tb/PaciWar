#Â PaciWar

Remake of the "pacifism" mode from Geometry Wars 2.

## Compilation

PaciWar uses CMake to create Makefile/IDE's project files. Additionnaly, 
you need SFML 2 to compile. The library is embedded and should automatically be found.

Linux (Makefiles), release version :
```
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Linux (Makefiles), debug version :
```
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

If you need more information about that, read [CMake 
documentation](http://www.cmake.org/runningcmake/).

## Building installer

At the moment, this is only tested on Windows.
PaciWar also uses CPack to build binaries/installers.
